### 🐾 Kurd Pets – Online Animal Marketplace (Final Year Project)

![Project Screenshots](available in the kurd-pets repository)

**Kurd Pets** is a full-stack, role-based online animal and pet-related product platform built as my final year graduation project. The platform enables customers to browse, filter, pre-order, and purchase pet-related products, while admins and super admins can manage content, orders, and tasks via a secure dashboard.
